    <h2>ATTENTION - Your character is locked until the first wave passes so that you don't sprint across the monster phase every level before they spawn.  This is annoying, yes... but it makes the game more fun overall. 
      You should hear a sound when your character is unlocked. <br /> <br />
    Instructions -- <br /> <br />
    This is your classic Frogger game! Use the arrow keys or W,A,S,D to hop across the grass without getting hit by the monsters! <br /><br />
    Then, try to stay afloat on the logs to make it across the water. Getting to the other side of the water will complete the level and increase the difficulty. <br /><br />
    If you are hit by a monster or unfortunately drown in the water, you lose one of your 3 lives. Hit 0 lives and game over!! <br /><br />
    Have fun!! <br /><br />
