    <h2>Instructions -- <br /> <br />
    This is your classic Frogger game! Use the arrow keys or W,A,S,D to hop across the grass without getting hit by the monsters! <br /><br />
    Then, try to stay afloat on the logs to make it across the water. Getting to the other side of the water will complete the level and increase the difficulty. <br /><br />
    If you are hit by a monster or unfortunately drown in the water, you lose one of your 3 lives. Hit 0 lives and game over!! <br /><br />
    Have fun!! <br /><br />
